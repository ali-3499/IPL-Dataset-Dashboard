Sunrisers Hyderabad

This implies that he doesn’t go all out in the top 6 overs and is pretty conservative upfront. If a franchise wants a safe, dependable and a consistent player, they can go for him.

DEATH OVER ANALYSIS FOR BATSMAN:
31.	One of the best finishers in the game, MS Dhoni, seems to be the best finisher taking IPL 2018-2020 when you consider both average and strike rate. He has a strike rate of 167.7 and average of 57.75 in overs 15-20. 
 

However on applying the filter on the last 2 seasons we find that his strike rate has dropped to 140 and average to 44. Further of filtering the 2020 season of the IPL he had a horrendous season with his strike rate dropping to 130 and average to 25.

32.	AB de Villiers seems to be the most dangerous batsman in the death overs with an average of 55 in the last 3 seasons and an average of 50 in the last 2 seasons with a whooping strike rate of 229.
33.	Ravindra Jadeja has a the best average and the 8th best strike rate in overs 15-20 among all the players
 

BEST DEATH BOWLERS:
34.	Rabada vs Bumrah: Who is the better death bowler?
Rabada has 36 wickets in overs 16-20, while Bumrah has 35. However, Rabada has played 2 extra matches than Bumrah. Also Bumrah has a far better economy (7.72) in the death overs as compared to Rabada (8.5)
 

35.	Rashid Khan, Chris Morris, Anrich Nortje, Mohammed Shami and Deepak Chahar have an economy under 8 when it comes to death overs. As run containment is more important when it comes to death overs they can all be good picks in the upcoming auction
 

36.	Jofra Archer surprisingly has a high economy in the death overs. His economy in the powerplay is under 6 whereas his economy in the death overs is 8.72(close to 9). However, he does pick up a fair amount of wickets in the death overs. Any franchise looking out for him should be wary of the fact that his strength lies more in bowling in the powerplay and not in the death overs.

TOP-10 BATSMEN OF ALL TIME: VULNERABLITIES
45.	Rohit Sharma: Rohit Sharma is clearly vulnerable against spinners. Most of his dismissals are against spinners like Sunil Narine, Amit Mishra and Ravichandran Ashwin. Any team playing against Rohit Sharma should try bowling spin upfront cause he is more vulnerable.
  
46.	Virat Kohli: He is legend of the game, and is technically sound but he is seen to be dismissed slightly more to right arm leg break bowling through caught out. Virat Kohli mostly hits the ball in the air and is out caught.
 
47.	David Warner: He is best oversees player, but he gets dismissed by off-spin bowlers. Hence any team playing against him can try bowling an off spinner upfront to dismiss him. 
48.	Chris Gayle: He is vulnerable to off-spin bowling. He is past his prime post 2014 and has never performed same as those levels.
 
49.	Shikhar Dhawan: He is left-handed batsman, and is vulnerable against medium pace bowling(bowlers around 120-130 kmph). Shikhar Dhawans runs are in an upward trend and is the only batsman who has outperformed their own records in each season of the IPL. On current form, he probably is the best batsman among the top 10 IPL greats.
 
50.	Robin Uthappa: Robin Uthappa has also been on a downward curve since 2015, and never performed at peak levels again. He may be in the top 10 highest run scorers in the IPL but has performed and scored lesser and lesser runs each season.
